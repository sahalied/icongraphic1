        <p>
          While New York City is one of the wealthiest cities in the world, more than 2 million New Yorkers are experiencing food insecurity. This means that these individuals are in a position of not having reliable access to enough quality,
          nutritious
          and
          affordable food. While many living in the Bronx have struggled with food insecurity for years, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed and increased inequalities for people from all walks of life. There are many
          organizations that exist solely to address food insecurity, but COVID-19 has complicated the already difficult process of distributing food.

        <p>

          "This virus represents an extreme and unprecedented hardship across our entire city but especially for our financially and medically vulnerable neighbors and it is absolutely critical that we rise to the challenge for them," said Food Bank
          for New York City CEO Leslie Gordon in an article written by the Bronx Times. "This is the new normal for New York City."

          <p> While all of the boroughs will see an increase in food insecurity this year, the Bronx and Brooklyn will see the highest. Feeding America reports that food insecurity in the Bronx will increase from 17.5% to 22.7% this year. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <i class="fas fa-bread-slice"></i>
          <p> 75% of the city's food pantries and soup kitchens — a valuable resource for those experiencing food insecurity — are reporting serving more people in April 2020 compared to the months leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak. 31%
            of those places report its numbers have more than doubled. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <i class="fas fa-people-carry"></i>
          <p> 91% of the pantries and kitchens that experienced an increase in visitors also reported a significant increase in first-time visitors, 79% reported an increase in visits from families with children and 59% reported an increase of
            undocumented immigrants. </p>

          <i class="fas fa-store"></i>
          <p> Hunger rates among children has grown nearly 50% since March according to a Hunger Free America report. Nearly four in ten parents said they've cut the size of meals or skipped meals all together for their children due to not having
            enough money for food. </p>
